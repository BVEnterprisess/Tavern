# Deployment Status Update

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Pushed to Correct Repository
- Successfully pushed to git@github.com:BVEnterprisess/Tavern.git
- This is the repository that Netlify monitors for auto-deployment
- Changes should now trigger a Netlify build and deployment

## Previous Issue
- Cocktails tab was not appearing on the live site (table1837tavern.bar)
- Investigation showed the deployed HTML did not contain the cocktails tab
- Root cause: We were pushing to wrong repository (origin vs upstream)

## Resolution
1. ‚úÖ Updated upstream remote to use SSH: git@github.com:BVEnterprisess/Tavern.git
2. ‚úÖ Successfully pushed latest changes to upstream repository
3. ‚è≥ Waiting for Netlify to detect changes and auto-deploy
4. üîç Will verify deployment in 2-3 minutes

## Next Steps
- Monitor Netlify deployment
- Verify cocktails tab appears on live site
- Test all functionality

## Timestamp
2025-01-XX - Deployment in progress
