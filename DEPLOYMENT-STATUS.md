# Deployment Status Update

## Current Issue
- Cocktails tab is not appearing on the live site (table1837tavern.bar)
- Investigation shows the deployed HTML does not contain the cocktails tab
- This indicates Netlify is not deploying the latest version

## Investigation Results
- Local HTML file contains cocktails tab: ✅ YES
- Deployed HTML contains cocktails tab: ❌ NO
- Git push to origin successful: ✅ YES
- Auto-sync script updated to push to both remotes: ✅ YES

## Next Steps
1. Verify Netlify is connected to the correct GitHub repository
2. Force a new deployment by triggering a build
3. Check if Netlify is configured to auto-deploy from the right branch
