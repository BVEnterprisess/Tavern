# Deployment Status Update

## ✅ SUCCESS - Latest Push to Correct Repository
- Successfully pushed to git@github.com:BVEnterprisess/Tavern.git
- Updated auto-sync script to prioritize upstream repository
- Netlify should now auto-deploy the latest changes

## Previous Issue
- Cocktails tab was not appearing on the live site (table1837tavern.bar)
- Investigation showed the deployed HTML did not contain the cocktails tab
- Root cause: We were pushing to wrong repository (origin vs upstream)

## Resolution Steps Completed

2. ✅ Successfully pushed latest changes to upstream repository
3. ✅ Updated auto-sync script to prioritize upstream repository
4. ✅ Pushed updated auto-sync script to upstream
5. ⏳ Waiting for Netlify to detect changes and auto-deploy (2-5 minutes)

## Next Steps
- Monitor Netlify deployment completion
